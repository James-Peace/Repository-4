# CS-250

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
User Stories Help to implement the customer needs into a program by giving examples of how the user will use the system. 
Take these exapmles and determine how the code needs to execute to provide the user that functionality.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
Whiteboards. Thus far in the CS program here at SNHU I have kept a whiteboard of sorts in my head. I decide what I want the program to look like, then make it happen. I however have never written it down in a whiteboard setup before. For instance during Intro to scripting I knew what I wanted my game to look like, but didn't write anything down. I just had this vision of what I wanted, and made it happen. THis could be streamlined and made simpler if I were to use an actual whiteboard, and maybe some sort of priorities scheduling.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Teams in a software development setting have to be open to all ideas, but also have to utilize communication in a very specific way. When multiple people are writing code for the same program, there have to be many things that are identical. Function names for instance cannot vary in any way between members of the team. THerefore team members have to comminicate very well together.
